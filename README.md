✋️Hello everyone.
🎯️I'm excited to share with you today a new online undergraduate curriculum that I've been developing for UDOM. This curriculum has a number of features that I believe will be really helpful for students and staff alike.

1️⃣️ *First*
One of the key features is an *API* that allows you to see all the courses that are available, as well as information about the colleges they belong to and other details. This API is really user-friendly and should make it easy for everyone to quickly find the information they need.

2️⃣️ *Second*
Another important feature is the *ajax search function*. This allows you to search for specific courses or colleges and see the results instantly, without having to reload the page. This will save a lot of time and make the curriculum much more efficient to use.

3️⃣️ *Third*
Another important feature of our udom online undergraduate curriculum is the use of *user-friendly URLs*, or 'slugs', to identify and access specific courses and resources on our website

4️⃣️ *Lastly*
I have also implemented a feature that allows users to *generate a PDF* for a specific program on our website. This feature is particularly useful for students and faculty who need to access course information offline or print it for reference.

🔗 To *generate a PDF* for a specific program, users can simply navigate to the program page on the website and click on the 'Generate pdf' button. This will generate a PDF document that includes all the relevant course information for that program, including college, descriptions, Knowledge and skills obtained, and more.

🔖 *And of course*, the fact that the curriculum is available online means that students and staff can access it from anywhere at any time. This is particularly important in today's digital age, where more and more people are working remotely or studying from home.

🔨 I've put *a lot of time and effort* into developing this curriculum, and I really believe that it has the potential to make a big difference for UDOM. So, without further ado, I'd like to give you a demonstration of how it works.
